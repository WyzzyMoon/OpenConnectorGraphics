# OpenConnectorGraphics

![Preview](preview.png)

A collection of free-to-use vector drawings of common connector types and ports.  
Because I never found a good set of high-resolution, open-source drawings of connectors that all match, I drew them myself. Please enjoy!  

They should be fairly accurate to about a millimeter or so, and the sizes match relative to each other. However, I took some artistic liberties here and there.  

I will most likely be adding more once I run into some I missed. Feel free to make requests as well!
